# programming-project-I-did-in-2020
cool description

This is the code for the programming project.
It demonstrates how bad at coding I was 2/3 years ago from now.

There are some logical issues, but the game works. Have fun.

Note 1: You need 2 accounts for the game to work, make an alt or play with a real life friend (if you have any).
Note 2: You need to remove the placeholder text from both txt files for it to work properly, I added placeholders to satisfy Githubs requirements when pushing assets.

The game is pure rng btw, no skill involved, its just the computer rolling dice and stuff happens.
